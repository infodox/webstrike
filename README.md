=========

'webstrike' is a web infiltration framework. It is designed for remote intrusion against targeted webservers. It will have the ability to: 

- perform reconnaissance and information gathering against a target:
	- fingerprint serverside technologies
	- discover defence technologies (wafs, hardened scripting environments, etc)
	- fingerprint popular web application CMS's, portals and gateways
- perform remote exploitation
- perform vulnerability scanning
- deploy customized and configuarble rootkits

This exploit framework will contain zeroday exploits and/or techniques either developed/discovered by myself or others

Testing

team, please, drop me an email.

All testing is performed on local networks.
